Microwave, model number 790.80329310, serial number KG35208185, that was manufactured in December 2013. It worked flawlessly until the night of May 14, 2015. That night, while using the the Kitchen Timer function to time something in the oven below he microwave, the vent fan came on and caught my attention. When I went to turn it off, the interior light was on, the turntable was turning, and the fan would not respond to me pressing the button. Actually , no buttons would respond at all, but the timer kept going. I unplugged the unit and waited for a minute or so, thinking the unit might reset itself. I plugged it back in and everything went back on: light, turntable, and blower. When I reached to place my right hand on the front of the unit to open the door with my left hand, the keyboard side of the unit was extremely hot, especially towards the rear. I opened the door to find the microwave safe, plastic food cover, melting onto the turnable on the side facing the keyboard. I immediately unplugged the unit. I do not know if the fan that turns on during the heating process was on or not. I could only hear the vent fan, which will drown out the sound of other fan anyway. I heard a noise about a minute before the vent fan came on automatically. The noise was a bumping sound, like something in the microwave bumps when it is heating. I think the control panel shorted somewhere, the magnetron came on melting the food cover making it pop on the turntable. The microwave finally got so hot, the vent fan turned on due to heat or a short of its circuit, which is what caught my attention. I firmly believe had I not been at home, the microwave would have continued to run, catching the kitchen cabinets on fire, and eventually the the whole house. The microwave was 1 month and 28 days out of its 1-year warranty.

It shattered /exploded on Monday June 1 2015. There was nothing on the desk, or near it that could have caused it to shatter the way it did. I found a report online of a woman who had a very similar experience as mine, except I was sitting at the desk when it occurred. Also, unlike the report and Ikea's insistence, the glass did not just shatter in safe cubes, it shattered into shards and powdered glass which was everywhere!! 
I have spoken with Ikea as well as their insurance company. I do not want anything in the form of monetary compensation, however Ikea is not accepting this is a safety hazard and the product should be recalled. It is ridiculous that a product that has the potential to do this can be deemed safe and only a quality issue instead of a safety issue. There are small children in the home and i am certain if they were in the room they would have been hurt because of the way height that the glass exploded and that it landed everywhere.

Other reports very similar if not identical to what I experienced.

In response to the attached notification from CPSC, Project Engineering and QA reviewed the product comprehensively and extensively.  The only possible solution to prevent the transmission wire from wrapping around children’s necks is to shorten the length of the wire to less than 220mm.  However, this change will significantly affect the play value of the vehicle as children would have to control the toy from a very short distance.

The Caterpillar Cement Mixer (36656) is an old item that we have produced for years, and has complied with all the regulatory requirements. There are many similar items on the market with a long transmission wires.  This is the first time we’ve heard such a complaint--a child wrapping the cord around his neck until it caused discomfort.

Considering the weight of vehicle and controller are 598g and 118g respectively—relatively light—and the transmission wire is 3.5mm in diameter, we do not believe the toy is a hazard. We would like to treat this issue as an individual case since we’ve only received one complaint of this nature.",

It also runs over the edge and can get on your feet with hot oil.  I contacted Blackstone right after the first time using it and sent them pictures and everything.  They pretty much told me that is the way the item is and deal with it by making sure you push the grease to the end as much as possible.  Even told me to put something under the left wheels to make it lean enough to run out quickly so it doesn't pool in the V.  If you only cook a few things on it its okay cause you can keep up.  Well we used it this weekend and had 12 hamburgers on it.  This grill can easily fit 12 hamburgers with plenty of room to spare as its 36"" wide.  Well the grease was staying right in the V like before right up to the lip and every time you tried to push it to the grip tray it would come over and splat on the ground.

They went to the kitchen to investigate and saw that that their dishwasher had whitish grey smoke coming from the operation panel in front with most of it coming from the right hand side of the panel.
The caller pushed the stop button on the panel but the unit did not respond to any of the buttons.
His wife opened door but the dishwasher kept running and spraying water out.
They then pulled the power cord from behind the dishwasher which stopped it.
They opened the doors & windows then set up fans to rid their home of the smoke.
The caller and his wife are reporting this incident realizing that this may be an older model, however they expect it to stop working but not catch fire.

There are no injuries to be reported.
The caller has not contacted the manufacturer but does intend to contact them.
The caller is requesting assistance from the manufacturer for purchase of a newer, safer dishwasher.",Pensacola,Florida,32504,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Female,My Spouse,,,Yes ,,Yes,,Yes ,Yes ,,"(6/24/2015) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: This product was previously recalled.

The consumer contacted Red River Motor Sports, LTD about a week ago regarding a possible recall on his vehicle. The consumer spoke to [REDACTED] (Service Manager) who asked him to submit a photograph of the tank. Mr.[REDACTED] was in contact with the manf in regards to issue with this vehicle. 

The consumer was informed that his vehicle is not included in alert #08-521 because his manf date falls out of the recall range. 

The consumer is experiencing similar hazards to alert #08-521. The consumer was informed that the unit can be repaired but it would be at his cost (about $1000). The consumer does not feel that he should have to pay for this repair since the manf is already aware of similar issues involving the fuel tank with other vehicles.

When they went to check what was happening, they noticed the smoke was coming from their coffee maker as the unit was melting.

The consumer indicates that the coffee maker stays on for two hours after the coffee is done in order to keep the remaining coffee warm.

The consumer indicates that this is the first time she has had any issues with this specific coffee maker, which is actually a replacement to another coffee maker of the same model that she owned. This original  coffee maker was replaced by the manufacturer because of the same problem: it had melted. For this same reason, the consumer does not intend to contact the manufacturer as she does not feel safe using their coffee makers.

The consumer checked online and found out that hundreds of reviews had been submitted on [REDACTED] about consumers who had similar issues to hers.
